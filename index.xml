      <description>My goal is to improve our understanding of the connection between voting, economic outcomes, public opinion, and the media through rigorous research. Before joining NYU, I have worked on projects related to discrimination, inclusive capitalism, and behavioral economics. Most of that work was done at MIT and at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
Teaching. As a Data Fellow at NYU, I have advised undergraduate students on research design, tidying data, and interpreting empirical results.</description>

      <description>I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Politics at NYU.
My academic work includes evaluations of the narratives surrounding the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and predictions of economic sentiment around the world with disciplined approaches to model selection inspired by machine learning.
In my role as a research associate at the NYU Center for Social Media and Politics I track, with my collaborators, voters&amp;rsquo; attitudes using survey data augmented with behavioral outcomes such as respondents&amp;rsquo; activity on social media.</description>
