## U.S. voting behavior over time (1916-2016). How competitive are U.S. presidential elections?

The objective of this project is to create a set of graphs that comply with the principles of good data visualization: namely, the charts should be *insightful*, but also *simple* enough for readers to digest the main message of each exhibit.

**Main product**: A self-contained Shiny app shows how the number "swing states" hinges on what we choose to count as a competitive election (at the state level). Most data journalists and researchers use data for recent elections; the app present will allow you to look at patterns for the last 25 U.S. presidential elections.

Access the set of visualizations via [shinyapp.io](https://zilinsky.shinyapps.io/how_competitive_are_us_elections/), or see the animations below.

**Product 2**: Using sankey plots, display county-level vote changes between 2012 and 2016. The user can choose to focus on a particular state, or to select counties that meet a specific condition.

**Third**, I represent recent election results, with `ggplot`.

## How many states were competitive between 1916 and 2016?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("charts/Swing_states_US_elections_since_1916_app.gif")
```

### How common were landslides?

In various elections, victories by more than a 20% margin wre common in many states:

Check the app to explore the pattern for yourself, or to determine which elections were unusual (or when a particular party had an especially difficult year).

See also: `charts/republican_vote_margin.gif)`.

## How many Democratic counties turned red in 2016?

- Are larger (more urban) counties more likely to vote for the Democratic nominee?
- Are larger counties more likely to **stick with** the Democratic nominee?
- How well does the state of the economy predict election outcomes?

### In what states were the blue counties least secure?

## Background information

The first part of the shiny app is built with `highcharter`. In addition to `shiny`, `shinythemes`, `RColorBrewer` and `tidyverse` are used. 

The second part relies on `sankeyNetwork` from the `networkD3` library. The last section uses `datatable` from the `DT` library.

This html document was built with R markdown.

The project is hosted on Github where my website is generated with `Hugo`.

### Data

I have collected and reshaped Democratic and Republican vote share data for most U.S. states between 1916 and 2016 from DataPlanet / U.S. Elections Atlas. If we interactively modify what thresholds count as "close results", how has the proportion of "swing states" changed over time? You can find out using my Shiny App.
