# Questions

Is America really divided into a blue and red nation (which allows political candidate to take most states for granted)?

If polarization is severe today, is the political landscape really that different compared to 50 or 100 years ago?

&lt;br&gt;

### What changed between 2012 and 2016? 

- Story 1: Republican voters energized by an unusual candidate.
- vs. Story 2: The country "moved" to the right.

## Magnitude of victory margins

In how many states was the victory "close"?

- What should count as a narrow victory? 
- A margin of 3 percent or less?

---

### "Close" races over time

But why choose a 3% cutoff?

## Choose your own threshold

## The margins are huge in some elections 

- It does not mean the system is not competitive
- The Reagan 1984 landslide:

# Evidence from counties

(2012 - 2016)

## Blue and red counties

---

## Large counties are more likely to be blue (and stay blue)

## Focus on specific states

## Comments on visualizing election results

- Many journalists discuss which states voted in a surprising way. But states are diverse, so analysts should also think about what is happening at the county level.

- Changes over time do not require us to display a fixed summary statistic over time. A time series perspective is sometimes approparite, but there are various way to show how the country is changing.

- Geography is important. But that doesn't mean the whole county should always be displayed at once.
