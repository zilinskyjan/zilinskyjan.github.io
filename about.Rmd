Before coming to TUM, I worked on my PhD at NYU, and worked on projects related to [discrimination](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214658X1630006X), [inclusive capitalism](https://piie.com/publications/piie-briefings/raising-lower-level-wages-when-and-why-it-makes-economic-sense), and behavioral economics. Most of these projects were done at MIT and at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

My goal is to improve our understanding of the connection between voting, economic outcomes, public opinion, and the media through rigorous research. 

**Teaching** 

As a Data Fellow at NYU, I have advised undergraduate students on research design, tidying data, and interpreting empirical results. My teaching experience is in three fields:

- *Data Science*: Taught topics in machine learning including model selection, false discovery rates, classification and decision trees, the bootstrap and cross-validation. I am also interested in teaching data visualization and text-as-data. 
- *Political Science*
- *Economics*: Designed and taught a course on experimental economics. TA-ed a large Behavioral Economics course led by David Laibson and Andrei Shleifer.
