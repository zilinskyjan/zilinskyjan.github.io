# Lecturer at the Chair of Digital Governance, TUM School of Social Sciences and Technology.
# My academic work evaluates the narratives surrounding the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and the relationship between economic sentiment and objective economic outcomes.
# I study the impact of social media on American politics. 
# In ongoing work at the [Center for Social Media and Politics](https://csmapnyu.org), my co-authors and I investigate how media consumption and exposure to misinformation influences voters' beliefs and decisions.
