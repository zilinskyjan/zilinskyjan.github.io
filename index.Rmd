# My academic work evaluates the narratives surrounding the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and the relationship between economic sentiment and objective economic outcomes.
# I study the impact of social media on American politics. 
```

My research analyzes how public opinion is shaped by the media, economic events, and political parties. With my collaborators we use surveys augmented with digital trace data to measure what voters know, what they believe, and to explain the sources of their behavior.
