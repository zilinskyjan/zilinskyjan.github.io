# My academic work evaluates the narratives surrounding the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and the relationship between economic sentiment and objective economic outcomes.
# I study the impact of social media on American politics.

My research analyzes how political competition is shaped and constrained by public opinion. Because voters' beliefs are influenced by the media, economic events, and political parties, my ongoing work at the [Center for Social Media and Politics](https://csmapnyu.org) zooms in on voters' knowledge and media consumption with surveys augmented with digital trace data.
