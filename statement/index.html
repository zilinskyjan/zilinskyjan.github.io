                 <p>I am interested in how actions of political elites &ndash; including not only elected leaders but a broad set of influencers who rely on either established or social media &ndash; affect voters&rsquo;s lives and decisions. Among the political choices I am interested are: conveyance of economic data and events, competition for elected office, and attempts to politicize new issues.</p>

<p>As political discourse permeates into citizen&rsquo;s screens and pockets, many observers worry that permanent campaigning, populist rhetoric, and echo chambers are eroding democracy. My work shows that satisfaction with democracy has not decreased in Europe over the last decade, young Europeans do not evaluate democracy more critically than older Europeans, and young Americans are no more interested in non-democratic alternatives than older Americans.</p>

<p>Even if democracy is durable, social conflict could arise if some groups feel the system is not working for them, or if they resent fellow citizens. To better understand these phenomena, my other published and ongoing work asks the following questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Can machine learning help us identify which aspects of the economy people value the most?</li>
<li>Are American users of social media exposed to diverse viewpoints?</li>
<li>Do citizens remember issue-based promises from election campaigns?</li>
<li>To what degree was there overlap between the appeal of Donald Trump&rsquo;s and Bernie Sanders&rsquo; messages?</li>
<li>How likely are Americans who avoid hard news to encounter political information? I document involvement of cultural elites (singers, actors, etc.) in political debates and campaigns to find out.</li>
</ol>

<p><br>
In an ongoing project, I also explore whether the media lose trust when it is perceived as trying to persuade not just inform, or when it is seen as talking down to readers with misleading headlines, clickbait, and other strategies that should not be classified as explicit ideological bias.</p>
