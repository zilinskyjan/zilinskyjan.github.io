      "contents": "\nEconomy (micro-level evidence)\nThe academic literature increasingly suggests that economic insecurity among white voters was not an important driver of Trump support\nThe latest contribution on the subject is Carnes and Lupu (2021). Using 3 sources (ANES, CCES and the VOTER Survey) they conclude that “the data does not support the simple idea that Trump himself uniquely mobilized the white working class, but the white working class’s participation in presidential elections has been slowly and steadily changing over the last two and a half decades in ways that have favored Republican candidates.”\nEarlier, Manza and Crowley (2017) found that “Trump’s primary support was not systematically derived from successful appeals to disadvantaged or downwardly mobile voters.”\n“Trump’s rise to the GOP nomination did not draw upon a significant base of economically threatened voters. Instead, ethnonationalist views were very significant predictors of Trump support.” (Manza and Crowley 2018).\nA surprising result based on a battery of personal-economic questions: Clinton voters “report[ed] more economic distress than Donald Trump voters” (Griffin and Sides 2018). They also report that “white Americans without a college degree report a lower level of [economic] distress than college-educated black and Hispanic Americans”. We also know that:\nTrump lost among low-income voters according to exit polls. He probably won among middle-income and high-earning people.\n“[W]hile economic considerations were an important part of the story, racial attitudes and sexism were much more strongly related to support for Trump” (Schaffner, MacWilliams, and Nteta 2018).\nOn race and economics, see also:\nGreen and McElwee (2019) on the evidence that economic hardship played a role in lowering turnout among voters of color.\nBaccini and Weymouth (2021): “white voters were more likely to vote for Republican challengers [incl. in 2016] where manufacturing layoffs were high, whereas Black voters in hard-hit localities were more likely to vote for Democrats.”\n\nThe economy as a contextual variable\nA negative or deteriorating state of voters’ communities, however, is associated with Trump support (among white voters):\nRothwell and Diego-Rosell (2016) document that Trump supporters are not more likely to be unemployed but they are more likely to be “living in racially isolated communities with worse health outcomes, lower social mobility, less social capital, greater reliance on social security income and less reliance on capital income, predicts higher levels of Trump support”.\nGrimmer and Marble (2019): “voters who reside in poorer zip codes support Trump at higher rates than they supported Romney. But the substantially improved economic conditions from 2012 to 2016 imply that many fewer voters reside in economically depressed zip codes”.\nHealth outcomes were identified as an important contextual variable in a number of papers (Bilal, Knapp, and Cooper 2018; Monnat and Brown 2017; Rothwell and Diego-Rosell 2016).\nAlso, in counties where poverty or the unemployment rate increased, Trump outperformed Romney (Fan and Pena 2020; Monnat and Brown 2017).\nFor other claims that the class or income mattered, see:\nFerguson et al. (2020), Morgan and Lee (2018), Morgan (2018).\nOgorzalek, Piston, and Puig (2019): “Trump’s support was concentrated among nationally poor whites but also among locally affluent whites”.\nCherlin (2019): argues it is a mistake to dismiss economic explanations: “They have largely focused on short-term measures such as current income and employment rather than the long-term decline of the kind of labor that provided people with a sense of pride and dignity”.\nCaution: “definitions [of the working class] in empirical literature are often wide ranging, suggesting differences in expected behavior” (Bucci 2017).\n\nIn the press, the working-class hypothesis has been discussed in:\nPorter, Eduardo. 2016. “Where were Trump’s votes? Where the jobs weren’t.” New York Times. December 13.\nCohn, Nate. 2017. “The Obama-Trump Voters Are Real. Here’s What They Think.” New York Times. Aug. 15.\n\nThe economic populism theory: On the campaign trail, Trump sounded like an economic progressive; “[his] promises to increase employment by improving trade deals and removing unauthorized immigrants could resonate in an era when employment levels for working age white men have declined, as might his calls for massive infrastructure spending and the jobs that would create” (Manza and Crowley 2017).\nA case for the importance of racial identity\nSides, Tesler, and Vavreck (2017): Voting was driven by “how [voters] felt about those who were different from them”. Moreover, it was “the centering of both campaigns on issues that tapped into Americans’ racial, ethnic, and social identities and attitudes.” They show that group attitudes predicted vote choice better in 2016 than in prior elections: “White voters’ attitudes toward African Americans were … more strongly related to their preferences in the Clinton-Trump contest than they had been to preferences in the general elections pitting Obama against McCain in 2008, and against Romney in 2012”.\nAnalyzing CCES data, Schaffner, MacWilliams, and Nteta (2018) report that “moving from the most acknowledging of racism to the most denying of racism was associated with a 60-point increase in support for Trump.”\nEngelhardt (2019) reports that “[i]n 2016, the most racially resentful Whites were on average about 45 percentage points more likely than the least racially resentful to support Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton.”\nBut did Trump activate racial attitudes or just benefit from them?\nOne paper skeptical of the popular activation hypothesis is Enns (2018): “the results from May 2015 suggest that those who expressed the most racial animus in surveys were already predisposed to support any Republican candidate”. On the other hand, Trump may have encouraged anti-immigrant sentiment: “[t]hose who previously supported Trump became more likely to support building a border wall” (Enns, 2018, panel data evidence). In addition, Trump’s rhetoric appears to have moved Democrats in a pro-immigration direction (but parties were already polarizing by racial attitudes before 2016).\nPartisan alignment by views on race: “While there was a time when racially resentful White partisans could be found in both parties—thereby diluting their impact by 2016, ethnonationalism had moved into partisan alignment” (Manza and Crowley, among others). See also Engelhardt (2020), Schaffner (2020a), and Schaffner (2020b).\nImmigration attitudes predicted vote-switching:\nWhite Obama voters with positive views of immigration almost universally supported Clinton, but about a third of white Obama voters with negative views of immigration reported voting for Trump (Sides, Tesler, and Vavreck 2017).\nPositive views of immigration among (white) Romney voters were also associated with vote-switching, i.e. voting for Clinton. However, there were fewer such voters overall: “[o]nly 14 percent of white Romney voters had attitudes that placed them on the positive side of the scale”.\n(Reny, Collingwood, and Valenzuela 2019): “vote switching was more associated with racial and immigration attitudes than economic factors, and that the phenomenon occurred among both working-class and nonworking-class Whites, though many more working-class Whites switched than did nonworking-class Whites.”\nSee also Garand, Qi, and Magaña (2020), Wright and Esses (2018), and Hooghe and Dassonneville (2018).\nEthnocentrism\nOpposition to allowing entry of Syrian refugees into the U.S. was among the best predictors of positive feelings toward Trump (Manza and Crowley 2018).\nPerceptions of discrimination against high-status groups and a belief that the American way of life was treated were associated with Trump support (Mutz 2018). But Morgan (2018) counters that the same panel data “are consistent with the claim that economic interests are at least as important as status threat”.\nGarand, Qi, and Magaña (2020) “those who have a strong American identity more [are] likely to translate immigrant threat perceptions into support for Trump than those with weaker levels of American identity”.\nLocal diversity\nNewman, Shah, and Collingwood (2018): “residing in a high-Latino-growth area is predictive of support for Trump following, but not before, his utterance of inflammatory and bellicose comments about Mexican immigrants”.\nHomegenous places that are spatially close to diverse counties favored Trump (Miller and Grubesic 2020).\nFreund and Sidhu (2017): “the change in the Republican vote share is positively correlated with manufacturing in predominantly white counties and negatively correlated with manufacturing in ethnically diverse counties, with these effects roughly offsetting each other.”\nBut Hill, Hopkins, and Huber (2019) consider the possiblity that “despite its disparate local impacts, immigration may be a symbolic, nationalized issue whose effects do not depend on local experiences”. They report evidence based on precinct-level data from 7 states, including key battle-ground states, and do not find evidence that “influxes of Hispanics or noncitizen immigrants benefited Trump relative to past Republicans, instead consistently showing that such changes were associated with shifts to Trump’s opponent.”\nAnti-Muslim attitudes\nNegative views of Muslims were highly prognostic of the vote in 2016 (Lajevardi and Abrajano 2019; Sides 2017), including in the primaries (Tucker et al. 2019; Levchak and Levchak 2019).\nGender\nSexism and views on women’s role in society were also predictive of vote choice (Stewart, Clarke, and Borges 2019; Bracic, Israel-Trummel, and Shortle 2019; Cassese and Barnes 2018; Glick 2019; Knuckey 2018; Valentino, Wayne, and Oceno 2018).\nOther work\nInsights from psychology\nWomick et al. (2018) find that “facets of [right-wing authoritarianism] RWA and [social dominance orientation] SDO predicted support for Trump (compared to other Republican, Democratic, and Libertarian candidates)”.\nIn contrast, Tucker et al. (2019) report that “populist attitudes and anti-Muslim bias were considerably more important than authoritarian dispositions, and immigration and trade policy attitudes in explaining support for Trump among Republicans”\nA key paper about voter misperceptions is McDonald, Karol, and Mason (2020): “many Americans are unaware that he was born into great wealth. This misperception increases support for Trump, mediated through beliefs that he is both empathetic and good at business.”\nBig-picture papers\nAmong some big-picture papers that I would recommend are: Jacobson (2017), Dickinson (2018), and Lewis-Beck and Quinlan (2019).\n\n\n\nBaccini, Leonardo, and Stephen Weymouth. 2021. “Gone for Good: Deindustrialization, white voter backlash, and US presidential voting.” American Journal of Political Science 115 (2): 550–67.\n\n\nBilal, Usama, Emily A Knapp, and Richard S Cooper. 2018. “Swing voting in the 2016 presidential election in counties where midlife mortality has been rising in white non-Hispanic Americans.” Social Science & Medicine 197 (January): 33–38.\n\n\nBracic, Ana, Mackenzie Israel-Trummel, and Allyson F Shortle. 2019. “Is Sexism for White People?
